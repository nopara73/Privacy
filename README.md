# Privacy

Series of videos to explore privacy research literature.

## Goal

The hypothesis is, presentation and discussion of various topics is a good way of solidifying and deepening knowledge.

## Implementation

### Summary

- Media Format: YouTube, vlog
- Schedule: every Monday, 3pm UTC
- Video Length: 15m +- 1m
- Content: privacy related, solid, specific, clear, non-controversial and magical concept, narrow scope
- Script: Narrative Hook (<2m), Intro (<1m), R-Mode (<5m), L-Mode (<10m, >3 jokes, >1 metaphore)
- Attitude: Dismiss negative comments.

### Media Format

- In 2019, the most engaging form of media is video.
- The largest video content sharing platform is YouTube.
- Vlogging is an ideal format as it requires the lowest effort to be put into video editing and production, hence it enables focusing on the content itself instead. It also helps avoiding copyright issues.

### Schedule

- There is consensus among YouTubers that posting less frequently than once a week isn't recommended and there is debate on more frequent content, which may signal diminishing returns.
- There is much debate on what day and what time it is best to post videos, which may signal high individual variance or the low significance of this question. Let's chose Mondays, as this is an educational channel, and the start of the week may be the the most approrpiate time when our viewers are most likely to benefit from our shows and maybe even follow up on them. Let's choose 3pm UTC, as most of our viewers are expected to be from the western world and western cultures appreciate privacy the most.

### Video Length

Recommended video lengths vary greatly, what may matters more is consistent video length to manage viewer expectations. A lower limit could be set at 10 minutes, as it would be difficult to explain complex issues in less time and an upper limit could be set at 20 minutes, as there is a rough consensus on viewer attention span around that number. However this is too broad range to consider it as consistent video quality, so let's settle in the middle at 15min +- 1min.

### Content

The topic of a video can be anything related to privacy. The scope of a video must be narrow and specific. The presenter must present a solid concept in a clear and conscious way.

### Script

#### I. Narrative Hook (<2m)

Start the video with a hook, to get the audience engaged right away. Various types of narrative hooks: https://www.writersdigest.com/online-editor/10-ways-hook-reader-reel-good

#### II. Quick Intro (<1m)

#### III. R-Mode (<5m)

"Engage an R-mode to L-mode Flow" (Andy Hunt - Pragmatic Thinking and Learning)

An example could be storytelling.

imagination, holistic thinking, intuition, arts, rhythm, nonverbal cues, feelings visualization, daydreaming

#### IV. L-Mode (<10m)

The actual presentation of the concept.

10 minutes L-Mode can be intense, so in order to keep the viewer's attention we need to cycle back to R-Mode once in a while with jokes and metaphores. Thus the criteria of this section is >3 jokes, funny moments, >1 metaphore.

#### V. Closing?

### Attitude

Categorically dismiss negative comments, as the goal of this video series is to learn and wasting time on negative comments is unproductive.

## ToDo/Brainstorming

- [ ] Closing: Call to action? Point to this GitHub and tell them to submit videos by themselves.
- [ ] How often to revise this doc?
- [ ] How many pre-recorded videos to make?
- [ ] Total number of videos?
- [ ] Do we need to introduce ourselves every time?
- [ ] Thumbnails how?
- [ ] Title how?
