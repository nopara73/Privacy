# Privacy

Series of videos to explore privacy research literature.

## Goal

The hypothesis is, presentation and discussion of various topics is a good way of solidifying and deepening knowledge.

## Implementation

### Summary

- Media Format: YouTube, vlog
- Schedule: every Monday, 3pm UTC,
- Video Length: 15m +- 1m

### Media Format

- In 2019, the most engaging form of media is video.
- The largest video content sharing platform is YouTube.
- Vlogging is an ideal format as it requires the lowest effort to be put into video editing and production, hence it enables focusing on the content itself instead. It also helps avoiding copyright issues.

### Schedule

- There is consensus among YouTubers that posting less frequently than once a week isn't recommended and there is debate on more frequent content, which may signal diminishing returns.
- There is much debate on what day and what time it is best to post videos, which may signal high individual variance or the low significance of this question. Let's chose Mondays, as this is an educational channel, and the start of the week may be the the most approrpiate time when our viewers are most likely to benefit from our shows and maybe even follow up on them. Let's choose 3pm UTC, as most of our viewers are expected to be from the western world and western cultures appreciate privacy the most.
- Total number of videos?

### Video Length

Recommended video lengths vary greatly, what may matters more is consistent video length to manage viewer expectations. A lower limit could be set at 10 minutes, as it would be difficult to explain complex issues in less time and an upper limit could be set at 20 minutes, as there is a rough consensus on viewer attention span around that number. However this is too broad range to consider it as consistent video quality, so let's settle in the middle at 15min +- 1min.
